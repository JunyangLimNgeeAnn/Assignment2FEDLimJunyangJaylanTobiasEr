Assignment 2 for FED

Teammates: Lim Junyang, Jaylan Tobias Er

Our idea for FED is to create a music quiz for everyone. To start, users would have to login or 
if they are new, are to sign up a account for the app. This application would allow for 
users to listen to a short version of the song, and are given 4 options to guess the correct 
answer, if they were to get the question correct, they would be awarded a point, if they got 
the question wrong, they would not be awarded any points. The points would be showed at the ending
page after the quiz, and the points would reset after any attempt at the quiz. There are mutiple quizzes
about different musical artists that users can try out. After doing these quizzes, they are able to quit the app
which would lead them back to the login page.

For the music, we do not claim credit for any of the artists music.
We used music by Bruno Mars, Coldplay, Taylor Swift for our app.
